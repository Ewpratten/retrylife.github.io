The majority of my programming experience is in the following areas (in no particular order):
 - Low level hardware programming
     - The [NI Re-configurable I/O](https://www.ni.com/en-ca/shop/compactrio.html) based [Athena system](https://www.ni.com/en-us/shop/hardware/products/roborio-advanced-robotics-controller.html?skuId=65909)
     - The [AVR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVR_microcontrollers) based [ATmega32u4](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATmega32u4)
     - The [AVR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVR_microcontrollers) based [ATmega328p](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATmega328p)
 - High level scripting
     - Python
     - JavaScript
 - Control systems
     - [Classical control theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_control_theory)
     - [Modern control theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory)

So far on my blog, I have covered each of these areas (and my mis-adventures) *except* AVR programming. Time to change that.
