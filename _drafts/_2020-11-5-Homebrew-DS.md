Like many people my age, I have an old Nintendo DSi laying around. Since the last time I have touched it, I learned how to program! Since DS stands for "Developer System", I figure that it would only be appropriate of I, a developer, try to write some code that can run on the system. This post won't cover writing nds programs, but instead, how to actually sideload custom software in the first place.

## The methods of sideloading


## Configuration



## But can it run DOOM?
