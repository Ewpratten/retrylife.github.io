ThriftyField is an open source alternative to the closed source FRC Field Management System (FMS).
The goal of ThriftyField is to provide an easy way to manage the states of many robots at once just like the real fields to, but only with a small amount of inexpensive equipment. ThriftyField can also keep track of scores entered on tablets via the web application and can generate a near real-time audience view just like an official event.
