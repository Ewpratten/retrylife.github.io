I am currently taking a class in school called [Music and computers (AMM2M)](https://www.facebook.com/studio225beal/), where as part of the class, whe get together into bands, and produce a song. After taking a break from music production for over a year, we have released our song for the class (we do two songs, but the second is not finished yet).

## My contribution
My main contribution to the project was a mix of live drumming, and most of the song's MIDI work. The song is far from perfect, but pretty good for the time we had to produce it.

## Just give me the song!
Ok. Ok. Here is the song:
