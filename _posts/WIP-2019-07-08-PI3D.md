## What is PI3D?
Project In 3 Days (PI3D) is a project I started in July of 2018 (1 year ago). The goal was simple: 
 - Start a project
 - Finish it within the next three days
 - Take a two or three day break
 - Repeat

## Why?
I started PI3D because I had a large number of small ideas that I wanted to try out, but did not want feel the need to continue supporting said projects in the long term. 

PI3D quickly became a great learning tool for me, and I rapidly improved my prototyping, research, efficiency, and programming skills. I get many comments from other people I work with about how quickly I take an idea and turn it into a program, a skill which I can confidently attribute to the time spent working on my PI3D projects. 

At this point, I would not be surprised if I am more fluent in Python than English.

## My favorite projects
Here are the projects I enjoyed working on and using the most:
 - [ThriftyField](https://github.com/frc5024/ThriftyField)
 - [Dirobium](https://github.com/Ewpratten/Dirobium)
 - [DevDNS](https://github.com/Ewpratten/devDNS)
 - [PWNLink](https://github.com/Ewpratten/PWNlink)

 - [Give Me A Distro](https://retrylife.ca/gmad/)
