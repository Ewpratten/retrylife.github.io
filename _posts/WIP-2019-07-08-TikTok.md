Here is a quick post. Now that it is summer and I have more free time than I should, Im going to be experimenting with posting videos of my projects on TikTok. These are things that are too short to post on youtube, and too random to post on twitter.

If Byte actually got released when it was supposed to, I would be using it instead.
