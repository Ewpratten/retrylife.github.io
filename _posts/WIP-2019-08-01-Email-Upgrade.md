Over the past year, I have been having issues with my retrylife.ca email addresses, but have finally fixed them. This post is mostly a reminder to myself for the next time I have to do this.

## DNS settings

## Setting up with Gmail

## Improvements 
To finish this up, Im looking to add catch-all, and suffix support to my email addresses. This would allow me to do something like: send all email from snapchat to `spam+snapchat@__domain__.ca`.
