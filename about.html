	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p style="text-align:left;font-size:medium;">Hi. I am the human behind this thing called RetryLife. There is a good chance that you have seen me somewhere on the internet. My username is usually <a href="https://twitter.com/ewpratten">@ewpratten</a> but sometimes I prefer to use a diffrent username because, why not? So.. what is RetryLife and why did I decide to invest my time into it? RetryLife is really just a name that I publish my work under. There is no set release schedule, and there is no video series as well. This is because I have to go to school and I also have other side projects that  I work on. RetryL:ife is just a fun thing that I use to publish anything that is music / video related (as well as some code here and there). This is all I have to say here for now, but I will probably change the site soon.</p>
