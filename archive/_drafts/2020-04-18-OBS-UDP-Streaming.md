I occasionally stream to [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/retrylife), and every time, I wish I had an HDMI capture card. The other day, I was streaming some [Warface](https://www.warface.com/en/) as a test, and devised this system for capturing my desktop, and combining it with my laptop audio & webcam feeds.
