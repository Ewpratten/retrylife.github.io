Idea - 
tri-split diagonal front landing page (angled titles?): 
 - Software
 - Photography
 - Radio

Tri-split on desktop, vertical cards on mobile?


Software Frontpage layout:
all sections are full height

 - Welcome hero : https://www.instagram.com/p/CC2BV7fJvIk/
 - Experience (dated list with outlinks)
 - Blog (side scroll)
 - Skills (cols with description)
 - Projects (side scroll)
 - Contact

Photography frontpage layout:

 - Hero image + title (drone, cameras, ... need to take this photo)
 - Floating vertical scroll examples linking out to instagram

Radio frontpage layout:

 - Together: Last heard (RBN + contacts) & farthest heard (rbn) & Last beacon (aprs)
 - Event log with spots + contacts (top 50) (emphasis on contacts (bright, pop out?))
