In this post, I explore the way a change in medium effects the reception of a story. This post is focused around the story of [Chanie Wenjack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chanie_Wenjack).

## Content vs Perception
A story can be told may ways, commonly: film, comics, novels, and articles. These different mediums allow for changes in the way a story is received, while keeping the actual content the same. 

Many people do not like watching a movie based off a book because the director's representation of places and people "ruin" what the viewer had believed from reading the original book. This makes total sense, as a book requires the reader's imagination to build a virtual world in order to understand distances, directions, and locations. Whereas, due to the nature of a film, everything is represented via visuals which override the world and images left to imagine by a book.

Aside from condensation of a book to fit the story into movie format, the actual content stays the same. When done well, any format change does not change the content to fit the new format, but instead makes use of the resources unique to that format to tell or show details that may me difficult to convert. For example, a narrator's opinion stated in a book could be integrated into a flashback in a movie or comic.
