title: Unofficial VSBRO
---

You have probably come here looking for a download link for my unofficial port of the [VSBRO](https://vsbro.co/) app to Android. Here is a little bit of info about what you are going to be downloading:

This app is developed in the cross-platform [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) framework, and works by making calls to VSBRO's webapp API. None of this is official, and none of it is supported directly by the VSBRO team.

In terms of features, this app is currently missing a lot of them :laughing:. Don't worry, I am most likely working on adding more features as you are reading this. My goal is to finish this app port by the end of the weekend.

Alright. I know you just want the download link. [Here it is](https://github.com/Ewpratten/vsbro_android/releases/latest). Make sure to download the `app-release.apk` file.
